A,"
Encourage switch to EV through corporate leasing. ",Area - Private Vehicles,zero_carbon_energy,"A transition to electric vehicles is enabled.
## Implementation Guidance
You will need to develop design guidance for EV charging points and build delivery partnerships to encourage wider investment and roll out in electric charging infrastructure.
## Risks and Limitations
You will need to consider investment in EV alongside investments in walking, cycling and public transport. 
## Considerations
Switching to EV reduces air pollution from cars which impacts air quality and therefore has positive implications for residents' health and well-being. However, wider considerations need to be given to metals required for the vehicles' batteries. Additionally, considerations need to be given to make sure the corporate leasing process is inclusive.

A,Exploit energy from waste opportunities,Area - Decarbonised  Power,zero_carbon_energy,"The area contributes to the decarbonisation of the national power network through investment and deployment of local renewable and micro-grid solutions. 
## Implementation Guidance
This should be complemented with enabling interventions focused on steering investment in low-carbon energy infrastructure and in circular waste management processes.
## Risks and Limitations
Whilst energy from waste can deliver low carbon power, and heat as a by product, there are a number of issues that need to be considered. There are concerns that energy from waste plants contribute to local pollution. There is a greater systemic consideration about whether energy from waste plants deliver a long term sustainable option in the context of a move to waste reduction and greater recycling as part of a circular economy. There is a concern that energy from waste plants could perversely stimulate demand for waste in the future and become a dead end technology.
